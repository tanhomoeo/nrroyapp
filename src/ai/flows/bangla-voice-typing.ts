// This Genkit AI flow for Bangla text correction has been removed
// as the application is now implementing direct browser-based voice-to-text
// using Web Speech API, per user request for a "Google Docs-like free feature".

// If AI-based text *correction* (not voice-to-text) is needed in the future,
// this file can be reinstated with appropriate Genkit setup.

// To prevent build errors from lingering imports, this file can be deleted
// or kept empty with a comment. For now, it's emptied with a comment.

console.warn("Genkit AI flow 'bangla-voice-typing.ts' is no longer active and can be removed.");

export {}; // Ensures the file is treated as a module if it's not deleted.
